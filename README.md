# PHP-CS-Fixer Configurator

This project lets you check all the available fixers and presets built in [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) in a visual way.

It allows you also to create configuration files via a guided interface.


## Updating the PHP-CS-Fixer data

The PHP-CS-Fixer data is extracted by a couple of PHP scripts.

> NOTE: on Windows, use backslashes (`\`) instead of forward slashes (`/`).

### One time setup

1. install [PHP](https://php.net/)
2. install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and add it to the `PATH` environment variable, so that it can be executed by running `composer`

### Updating the data to the most recent versions

```sh
./bin/update-docs-all
```

### (Re)Generate the data for all the versions

```sh
./bin/update-docs-all --force
```

### Generating the data for a specific version

For example, to (re) generate the data for version 2.15.1:

```sh
./bin/update-docs 2.15.1
```


## Building the web application

The web application is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and it's compiled with [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/).

### One time setup

1. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - including npm.
2. run
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Building the app for production

```sh
npm run prod
```

### Building the app while developing

```sh
npm run watch
```
